## Chapter 1: Node.js Fundamentals
- Node.js is one of popular javascript-driven technologies nowdays.

### Node.js Architecture
* Node.js like other high performance servers architecture has an event loop operation with non-blocking input/output
* Most of the servers written in Java or C use multithreading.this means that they process every request in a new thread.
* Node.js use a single-thread architecture, this means that all the request that come to server are processed by a single-thread.
* Node.js is scalable and to achieve this we just have to run diffrenet Node.js processes and use a load blancer that distributes the requests between theme.
